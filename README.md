# Project Non-Gravitar
!["Gravitar cover"](./gravitar.jpg "Gravitar cover")

University of Bologna 2018/19 Programming project (CS course), aiming to
produce a reduced C++ implementation of the Atari 1982 game
[Gravitar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitar). This project is still being
discussed, so you won't find much before a certain time.
